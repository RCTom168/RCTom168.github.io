## Introduction
In the last half-century, the name “_Zika_” has grown from an obscure word to something that invokes a feeling of unease and dread. Travel warnings have been issued as governments and international organizations work to find solutions for the disease.  

But how has this affected the United States, and what areas have been impacted the most?

## The Zika Virus
The Zika virus derives its name from the Zika Forest in Uganda. It is a part of the Flaviviridae virus family. It is related to many other infamous diseases such as the dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.

It’s primary disease vectors are members of the Aedes genus of mosquito, such as the Yellow Fever Mosquito & the Asian Tiger Mosquito. Historically these mosquitos were confined to a narrow tropical and subtropical area around the equator, but due to climate change and human activity, they are now found all over the world, bringing diseases such as Zika with them.

## Effects of the Zika Virus
The Zika fever is the infectious disease that a person infected with the Zika virus experiences. Some people may suffer no symptoms and those that do usually only get mild discomfort from things such as a fever, headache, and a rash.

In rare, more severe cases it can lead to an an onset of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults, which is results in the rapid onset of muscle weess throughout the body due to the immune system attacking the peripheral nervous system.

However, the primary danger with the Zika virus that is well-publicized in the media is the negative effects that it has on pregnancies. The Zika virus is known to be able to spread from a mother to a child in the womb and result in many birth defects for the baby.

The most prevalent of these is microcephaly, a condition in which the brain of a baby does not develop properly and results in a smaller than normal head. Babies born with this condition can grow up with intellectual problems, brain damage, seizures, vision and hearing deficits, and overall slow development.

## Research Topic
### Datasets
The Zika Virus Epidemic of 2015 - 2016 brought the Zika virus into the public eye. The first major cases of Zika began to appear in the U.S. at the beginning of 2016.  

The datasets that I pulled from come from the Buzzfeed’s collection of CDC datasets. I picked the ones from September 28, 2016 - April 26, 2017, because there was data collected for almost every state in this time frame and it yielded 8 datasets to utilize.  

### Question
* Which states have the highest exposure of Zika?  

### Hypothesis
* The states that border the country of Mexico will have the highest cases of Zika.  
* This would include the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

### Reasoning
* This is because the Zika virus thrives closest to the equator. The U.S. is above the equator and this habitat, but a very large portion of Mexico is located within this area.  
* Because mosquitos do not need to adhere to international boundaries (and flying over land would be easier than flying over ocean water), this is likely to be the areas where the mosquitos and Zika virus will congregate.

### Null Hypothesis
* The U.S. states that border the country of Mexico will not have the highest number of Zika cases.  

### Results
Over this 8 month period, it appears that the Zika Virus was spread throughout the U.S. and could be found in almost every state. However, while California and Texas have notably high concentrations of Zika cases, by comparison, Arizona and New Mexico do not.

Moreover, the amount of Zika cases appears to be the most highly concentrated in the east coast states, with New York and Florida overwhelmingly having the highest amounts.

In this case, it looks like the stated null hypothesis has more support than my hypothesis.

### Interpretations
It appears that the spread of Zika in the U.S. is not as restricted to the ability of the mosquitos to travel, nor whether or not the conditions for the Zika virus to thrive are present. From the information available, it looks like the ability of the Zika virus to spread has more to do with the mobility of their human hosts and the presence of large populations of new hosts to move between. 

The research done by the CDC appears to support this as well. They noted that most of the cases of Zika that they recorded appear to have been something contracted while a person was traveling outside of the U.S. and then brought back with them when they were not yet displaying symptoms.
