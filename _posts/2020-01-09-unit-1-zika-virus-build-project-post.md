## Introduction
In the last half-century, the name “_Zika_” has grown from an obscure word to something that invokes a feeling of unease and dread. Travel warnings have been issued as governments and international organizations work to find solutions for the disease.  
But how has this affected the United States, and what areas have been impacted the most?

## The Zika Virus
The Zika virus derives its name from the Zika Forest in Uganda. It is a part of the Flaviviridae virus family. It is related to many other infamous diseases such as the dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.  

It’s primary disease vectors are members of the Aedes genus of mosquito, such as the Yellow Fever Mosquito & the Asian Tiger Mosquito. Historically these mosquitos were confined to a narrow tropical and subtropical area around the equator, but due to climate change and human activity, they are now found all over the world, bringing diseases such as Zika with them.
