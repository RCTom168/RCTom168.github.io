## Introduction
  In the data science world, there are many different machine learning algorithms to choose from. Each one is unique in its function and complexity. 

Some of the most notable ones are:
  1) K-Means Clustering
  2) K-Nearest Neighbors
  3) Decision Tree Learning
  4) Naive Bayes Classifier
  5) DBSCAN Clustering
  
Today, I will be breaking down, analyzing, and recreating the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
