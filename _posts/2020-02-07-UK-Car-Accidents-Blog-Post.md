title: UK Car Accidents Project

## Introduction
Traffic accidents are a risk that many of us encounter in our everyday lives. It is a sad reality that every time we step outside near a road, or commute to work there is a chance that we will be impacted by one. A person does not even have to be in a car to be affected.

But what is it that determines how severe a car accident will be? I decided to take a look at car accident reports in the United Kingdom to see if we can find anything interesting.

## Predicting Car Accidents in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom's Department for Transport does a pretty good job of keeping track of information regarding road safety. The official statistical publication on traffic casualties, fatalities, and related road safety data is called the Reported Road Casualties Great Britain. The data collection method is based primarily off of STATS19, an accident reporting form and format that has been in use since 1926.
